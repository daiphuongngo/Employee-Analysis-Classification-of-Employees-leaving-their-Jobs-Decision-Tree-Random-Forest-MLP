# Employee-Analysis-Classification-of-Employees-leaving-their-Jobs-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-MLP

## Overview:

## Language, Classification Methods, Tool:

- Python

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Multi Layer Perceptions (MLP) 

- Deep Neural Network

## Classification requirements

- Based on the Train set, predict on the Test set which employees would quit the jobs (field 'Attrition')

- Find out the main reason why they leave their jobs

- Examine an HR policy to retain the employees and specify how it would affect their decisions

## Dataset

- train.csv with size (1000,27)

- test.csv with sizec (470,26) 

## Targets

- Follow with steps of classification using Tree

- Visualize datasets

- Calculate correlations between features

- Process categories

- Build model and compare accuracy of the Decision Tree with other models using other algorithms

- Use model to predict and examnine hypothesis

## Correlation between features using the Pearson correlation

$r_{xy}={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})(y_{i}-{\bar {y}})}{{\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\bar {x}})^{2}}}{\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-{\bar {y}})^{2}}}}}$
